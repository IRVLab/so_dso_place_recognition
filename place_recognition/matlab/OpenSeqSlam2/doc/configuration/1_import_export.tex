\parbox{\textwidth}{SeqSLAM configurations are stored as simple *.xml files. They can either be edited manually, or through the GUI.}
\bigskip
\parbox{\textwidth}{Tips: \\ --- There are example configurations for the sample datasets in \textit{./.config/} \\ --- The configuration in \textit{./config/default.xml} is used by default when the GUI is first opened \\ --- The \textit{\$TOOLBOX\_ROOT} variable is used in *.xml configuration files to record addresses relative to the toolbox where possible (like when saving to the \textit{./dataset/} directory) \\ --- When saving results, the *.xml configuration file is also saved with the results}
